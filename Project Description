My final project task was to create a mail.ru website testing automation framework.
To accomplish this I have constructed a Maven project with the Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, MySQL connector, Log4j, 
commons-io libraries. Description of test scripts is located in separate .feature-files. 
Some tests I made in TestNG test classes which runs by suite.xml file (variety purely for educational purposes).
In my project I implemented POM design pattern. User data stored in the MySQL database, this data is read using JDBC connection.
Part of the data is stored in xml file, data extraction is done using DOM parser.
Project supports the ability to log (Log4j).
One test class implements putting screenshots of each step of the tests in a specific folder.
